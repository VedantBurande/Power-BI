Implemented various data transformation techniques to normalize and aggregate data.
Created calculated columns and measures for more in-depth analysis.

3. Data Visualization:
Developed interactive dashboards using Power BI.
Created a variety of visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs.
Ensured visualizations were intuitive and effectively communicated insights.

4. Performance Optimization:
Implemented best practices to optimize report performance.
Removed unnecessary columns and tables to reduce data model size.
Used DAX to create efficient and dynamic calculations.

5. Key Insights:
